                <p>Hi! My name is Vicky. I'm a student currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. I'm very passionate about design and illustration; my dream is to work professionally designing brands, merchandise, and advertisements as a graphic designer. In my free time, I love:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="hobby-list-item">drawing</li>
                    <li class="hobby-list-item">listening to music</li>
                    <li class="hobby-list-item">hanging out with my cat</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I've been the creative type since childhood, but started to consider a career in the field of design during high school when I took my first graphic design class. I quickly became infatuated with designing layouts, using different typefaces, and creating art that was practical and had purpose; it felt so rewarding to use my creativity to solve design problems and fulfill the needs of people. I'm <em>super</em> excited to keep learning and improve my abilities to bring me closer to my dream of becoming a graphic designer!</p>
